# VoiceLink – Admin Docs & Federation Visibility

## Admin Docs

/admin/docs is ONLY visible to logged-in administrators.

Public users must never see:
- Federation internals
- Licensing logic
- Plugin management
- Internal APIs

---

## Documentation Tiers

1. Public – basic usage
2. User – federation & settings
3. Admin – node control & trust

---

## Federation Visibility

### Public List Shows:
- Canonical server
- Publicly listed nodes

### Hidden Nodes:
- Private instances
- Test servers
- Home-hosted nodes

Hidden nodes still federate.

---

## Accessing Non-Public Nodes

Admins and advanced users may:
- Navigate directly by URL
- Add nodes manually
- Access via internal tools

Visibility ≠ capability.

---

## In-App Discovery

Features:
- Browse servers
- Search by domain/name
- Filter out canonical server
- Separate public vs community

---

## Canonical Server Rules

- Always available
- Always trusted
- Never forced
- Filterable in UI

---

## Accessibility

- Keyboard navigable
- VoiceOver readable
- Linear flows
- Spoken context for server types

---

## Summary

Federation is open.
Visibility is curated.
Admins see everything.
Users see what’s safe.
