# VoiceLink Local - P2P Voice Chat System

A comprehensive voice chat application with native desktop clients (not Electron), featuring 3D binaural audio, multi-channel support, VST plugin streaming, and advanced security features.

## Platform Priority Policy

- Desktop app is the primary VoiceLink experience.
- Desktop clients are native apps (macOS/Windows), not Electron.
- iOS builds should include the same desktop features as much as possible.
- Web app is secondary and receives a subset of features.
- Features not implemented for web must be hidden for web users.
- New feature work should target desktop first, then web support where practical.

## Current Implementation Status (Audit: 2026-02-11)

- Active native desktop source is currently maintained in `../voicelink-local/swift-native/VoiceLinkNative/Sources` and `../voicelink-local/windows-native/VoiceLinkNative`.
- This repo currently still contains Electron build/runtime scripts in `package.json` for legacy compatibility and web-runtime packaging paths.
- In this repo, `swift-native/VoiceLinkNative` currently contains build artifacts and packaged outputs, not full source files.
- In this repo, `windows-native/VoiceLinkNative` currently contains build output/intermediate files, not full source files.

## Desktop + API Parity Checklist
